# SPSS Final Training – Statistical Analysis Project

A practical SPSS project focused on applying core statistical analyses including One-Way ANOVA,
Simple Linear Regression, and Correlation Analysis using a training dataset.

---

## 📊 Project Overview
This repository contains a final practical training project using IBM SPSS Statistics.
The project is based on a training Excel dataset consisting of 386 cases and aims to apply
statistical analysis techniques learned during the course.

All analyses are conducted using the same dataset without modifying the original data.

## 🧪 Statistical Analyses Performed

### 1️⃣ One-Way ANOVA
- **Dependent Variable:** Training Satisfaction
- **Independent Variable:** Educational Level  
- **Research Question:**  
  Are there statistically significant differences in mean training satisfaction due to differences in educational level?

**Results include:**
- Significance level (Sig)
- Interpretation in simple language

---

### 2️⃣ Simple Linear Regression
- **Independent Variable:** Number of Training Hours
- **Dependent Variable:** Test Performance  
- **Research Question:**  
  Can test performance be predicted based on the number of training hours?

**Results include:**
- Coefficient of determination (R²)
- Regression equation (a + bX)
- Interpretation in simple language

---

### 3️⃣ Correlation Analysis
- **Variables:** Motivation and Academic Performance  
- **Research Question:**  
  Is there a statistically significant correlation between motivation and academic performance?

**Results include:**
- Correlation coefficient
- Significance level (Sig)
- Interpretation in simple language
